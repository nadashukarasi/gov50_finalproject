## Project thoughts
I am interested in working on data related to elections in Albania from 1990 to 2023 and how the preferences of the population have changed post-communism. My project could potentially be about how the population has reacted to election candidates throughout the years after 1990 and see whether there is a correlation between the prefered political party and how to population feels about government control.
